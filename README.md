Trump Tweet Translator
The translator was created as a capstone project to showcase my skills using API calls, specifically the fetch method. The project idea was spawned from the observation that translating English into other languages then back to English can be humorous. And what better source to translate from than Donald Trump's tweets! Hope you enjoy!

Summary
The translator gets a random tweet from the What Does Trump Think API (https://whatdoestrumpthink.com/api-docs/index.html), then runs it through some translation APIs including: MyMemory API (https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/) and Yoda Translator API (https://funtranslations.com/api/yoda). The first translation is English to Yoda speak. After that, it sends the Yoda speak translation to translate it into Chinese. From there, it takes the language that the user selected on the page to translate into from Chinese. Lastly, a translation from that language to English and displays for the user.
